# Todo Evolution - Phase I

A CLI-based task management system built with Test-Driven Development and Spec-Driven Development principles.

## 🎯 Overview

Todo Evolution is a command-line todo application developed as part of the 5-Phase "Evolution of Todo" hackathon project. Phase I implements core task management functionality with in-memory storage, comprehensive testing, and a clean CLI interface.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks** - Create new todo items
- ✅ **List Tasks** - View all tasks with status
- ✅ **Complete Tasks** - Mark tasks as done
- ✅ **Delete Tasks** - Remove tasks from the list
- ✅ **In-Memory Storage** - Fast, project-local task persistence
- ✅ **JSON Output** - Machine-readable output format
- ✅ **Test-Driven** - 46 passing tests with 100% coverage

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd todo-evolution

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Link the CLI globally
npm link
```

## 📖 Usage

### Add a Task

```bash
todo add "Buy groceries"
# Output: Created task #1: Buy groceries

todo add "Finish homework"
# Output: Created task #2: Finish homework
```

### List All Tasks

```bash
todo list
# Output:
# ID  Status     Description
# 1   [ ]        Buy groceries
# 2   [ ]        Finish homework
# 2 tasks (0 completed, 2 pending)
```

### Complete a Task

```bash
todo complete 1
# Output: Completed task #1: Buy groceries

todo list
# Output:
# ID  Status     Description
# 1   [✓]        Buy groceries
# 2   [ ]        Finish homework
# 2 tasks (1 completed, 1 pending)
```

### Delete a Task

```bash
todo delete 2
# Output: Deleted task #2: Finish homework

todo list
# Output:
# ID  Status     Description
# 1   [✓]        Buy groceries
# 1 task (1 completed, 0 pending)
```

### JSON Output

All commands support `--json` flag for machine-readable output:

```bash
todo list --json
# Output: [{"id":1,"description":"Buy groceries","status":"completed"}]
```

### Get Help

```bash
todo --help
# Shows all available commands and options

todo add --help
# Shows detailed help for the add command
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Tech Stack

## 📋 Spec-Driven Development

This project was developed using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code following these principles:

1. **Constitution First** - Defined project principles and governance
2. **Specification-Driven** - Wrote detailed specs before implementation
3. **Test-First** - TDD approach with red-green-refactor cycle
4. **AI-Generated Code** - Implementation generated by Claude Code based on specs
5. **Iterative Refinement** - Refined specs until code met requirements

### Key Principles

- ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- ✅ CLI-First Interface
- ✅ Simplicity & YAGNI
- ✅ Observability
- ✅ Code Quality Standards

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- **Test Files:** 6
- **Total Tests:** 46
- **Pass Rate:** 100%
- **Coverage Areas:**
  - Task CRUD operations
  - CLI command parsing
  - Storage layer
  - Output formatting
  - Error handling

## 📦 Storage

Tasks are stored in a `.todo` file in the current working directory in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "Buy groceries",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "description": "Finish homework",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```

## 🚧 Roadmap

Phase I is complete! Future phases will add:

- **Phase II:** Full-stack web application (Next.js + FastAPI + Neon DB)
- **Phase III:** AI-powered chatbot with natural language commands
- **Phase IV:** Local Kubernetes deployment
- **Phase V:** Advanced cloud deployment with Kafka and Dapr
